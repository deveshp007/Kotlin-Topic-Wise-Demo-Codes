/*Enum class properties and functions â€“
Since enum class in Kotlin, defines a new type. This class
type can have its own properties and functions. The
properties can be given a default value, however, if not
provided, then each constant should define its own value
for the property. In the case of functions, they are
usually defined within the companion objects so that they
do not depend on specific instances of the class. However,
they can be defined without companion objects also.

    WEDNESDAY,
