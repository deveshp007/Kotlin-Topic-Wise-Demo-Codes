/*Extensions are resolved statically â€“
One important point to note about the extension functions
 is that they are resolved statically i.e. which extension
 function is executed depends totally on the type of the
 expression on which it is invoked, rather than on the
 type resolved on the final execution of the expression at
  runtime.
