/*Multiple Interface Implementation â€“
Since classes in Kotlin follow the concept of single
inheritance, that is, each class can inherit only class,
however, in case of interfaces a class supports multiple
 inheritance, also known as multiple conformance in Kotlin.
  A class can implement more than one interface, provided
   that it provides a definition for all the members of
   the interface.
